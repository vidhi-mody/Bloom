    <p>
      Making healthy lifestyle changes is easier said than done. Even when we're strongly motivated, 
      adopting a new, healthy habit — or breaking an old, bad one — can be terribly difficult. Creating and 
      maintaining healthy eating habits doesn’t have to be hard. If you start by incorporating small changes 
      into your daily habits, you can make a big impact on your eating pattern and create lasting, healthy eating 
      habits. Bloom wants to help you do just that!

    <hr>
    <p>
      How many recipes can I get for a given input? <br>
      Due to API constraints, you can get a maximum of 5 dishes per input. In future, a Bloom Pro User can get access to more recipes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bot did not answer my question correctly. Why? <br>
      We tried our best to train our bot according to the needs of the user, however since there isn't a person on the other side, there isn't much we can do about it. Drop us a message for anything urgent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do I need Google Fit installed? <br>
      We make use of the Google Fit API for tracking fitness related information, hence you must have google fit downloaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is this site legit? <br>
      This site is opensource and was created as a prototype for Hack UMass. Most of the services however are functional and you are free to use them! :)
