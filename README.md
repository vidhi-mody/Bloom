## Inspiration

Making healthy lifestyle changes is easier said than done. Even when we're strongly motivated, adopting a new, healthy habit — or breaking an old, bad one — can be terribly difficult. Creating and maintaining healthy eating habits doesn’t have to be hard. If you start by incorporating small changes into your daily habits, you can make a big impact on your eating pattern and create lasting, healthy eating habits. Bloom wants to help you do just that!

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### How is this tool helpful?

- Goals: Your first step towards a healthy lifestyle is setting two goals. The first goal is your target number. Once you've set this goal, next is to figure out your deadline. Be realistic about them.
- Exercise Plan: Exercise at a local gym, go for a jog or try those workout videos at home! However you choose to exercise, a great way to help you stay focused on your goal is to use a fitness tracker.
- Eating Right: In addition to your new exercise routine, you will also be changing your diet. But don't think of it as dieting, you will simply be forming new and healthier eating habits.

### Key Features

- The Healthy Recipe Guide: A list of curated recipes based on your ingredients, calorie intake, etc
- Lifestyle Tracker: Track your steps, calories, etc with the lifestyle tracker
- The Healthy Bot: Ask the bot anything health related and it will answer your questions
- Gym and Hospital Locator: Get a list of the nearest hospitals and gyms based on your location
- Retrospective Tracker: Analyse your mood and let it all out in your daily journal
- The Community Forum: Make Healthy Changes and share tips, achievements and advice!
